* **IP Reputation:** Instantly check if an IP address has been flagged by security vendors.
* **Hash Lookup:** Query SHA-256, SHA-1, or MD5 hashes to see historical scan results without re-uploading the file.
* **Domain Analysis:** Cleanse and check domains/URLs for phishing or malware associations.
